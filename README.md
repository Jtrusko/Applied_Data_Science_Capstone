# Applied_Data_Science_Capstone
IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Capstone Project


Executive Summary:
In this project, I am acting as a data scientist for a fictional company called SpaceY, founded by Allon Musk, aiming to compete with SpaceX. SpaceX significantly lowers its launch costs by successfully reusing the first stage of its Falcon 9 rockets. My task is to gather and analyze public SpaceX data, build interactive dashboards, and develop a machine learning model to predict whether the first stage will land successfully. This prediction will help estimate launch costs, allowing SpaceY to better compete without relying on complex rocket science.
